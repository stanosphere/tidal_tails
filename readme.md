# tidal_tails
This was my 3rd year computational project. I needed to investigate the properties of tidal tails of interacting galaxies. This is also the first major piece of code I ever wrote. The final part of the project involved adding a dark matter halo to what happens.

## Depends

```numpy scipy matplotlib```

## Run

```python3 Animations.py``` to see animation of interaction
```python3 5_Rings.py``` to see animation of 5 rings
